dotfile, but sway

use chezmoi for manager dotfile (https://chezmoi.io/)

all keymap use in sway is default key, some shortcut and
keymap switcher is modified.you need to read in 

`sway/config.d/keymaps`

you can read about sway keymap from

also, it's suitable for fedora because i use this distro
on daily use, for other, i recommand to use arch as first
choice if you can't use fedora.
