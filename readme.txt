use chezmoi for manager dotfile (https://chezmoi.io/)

all keymap use in sway is default key, some shortcut and
keymap switcher is modified. you need to read in 

`sway/config.d/keymaps`

you can read about sway keymap from
https://depau.github.io/sway-cheatsheet/

also, it's suitable for fedora because i use this distro
on daily use, for other, i recommand to use arch as first
choice if you can't use fedora.

other, i inserted original file in some config as "comment"

fonts
i use azuki_font (http://azukifont.com/font/azuki.html) in
gui, alternative is JetbrainsMono, and requirement nerd font
for display some icon (ex, waybar)

last word, if you don't need to use swayfx, or you can use
only sway (standalone), comment swayfx block in swayconfig,
and need remove `dot_gitconfig` before apply
